  title: Prediction of skin sensitization potential
  description: |
    Skin Doctor CP is a machine learning model for the classification of small organic
    compounds into skin sensitizers and non-sensitizers. More specifically, the core of
    Skin Doctor CP is a random forest binary classifier that is enveloped in an
    aggregated Mondrian conformal prediction framework. This allows users to define an
    error significance level (i.e. error rate) for classification. Predictions (i.e.
    sensitizer or non-sensitizer) are thus only reported for compounds for which the
    expected reliability reaches or exceeds the error rate defined by the user. The
    error significance level parameters of the framework can be adjusted, as described
    in the box below.

    Skin Doctor CP is trained on a curated data set of 1285 compounds measured in the
    local lymph node assay (LLNA).

    Skin Doctor CP has been developed in collaboration with [Beiersdorf
    AG](https://www.beiersdorf.com). The web service is free for non-commercial and
    academic research purposes only.

  additional_information: |
    Skin Doctor CP allows the selection of four different error significance levels. For
    each of the selected error significance levels the model will provide predictions
    with a maximum error equal to the error significance level. The default values
    correspond to the four error significance levels used in the Skin Doctor CP
    publication.

    ## About Skin Doctor CP

    Skin Doctor CP is a machine learning model for the classification of small organic
    compounds into skin sensitizers and non-sensitizers. More specifically, the core of
    Skin Doctor CP is a random forest binary classifier that is enveloped in an
    aggregated Mondrian conformal prediction framework. This allows users to define an
    error significance level (i.e. error rate) for classification. Predictions (i.e.
    sensitizer or non-sensitizer) are thus only reported for compounds for which the
    expected reliability reaches or exceeds the error rate defined by the user.

    Skin Doctor CP is trained on a curated data set of 1285 compounds measured in the
    local lymph node assay (LLNA). As of October 2020, this curated data set is the
    largest of its kind.

    ### Further Information

    Details on the methods and performance of the model is provided in accompanying
    publication (to be published).

    #### How to use the Skin Doctor Suite web service

    Enter SMILES, draw a molecule, or upload a file (.smi or .sdf) containing up to 100k
    molecules. The .smi file must contain exactly one SMILES per row. If additional
    information is provided for a molecule, it should be separated from the
    SMILES notation by a single space character.

    Optionally, select a significance level different from the default value by moving
    the slide bars to the desired value.

    Click the submit button to start the calculations. You will then be forwarded to the
    results page.

    #### Output

    The results of the calculations will be displayed as a color-coded table.
    Additionally, users can download the results as a .csv file or check the results
    online at a later point in time using the web link provided. Results will be deleted
    permanently after 60 days or as soon as the user clicks on the “Delete results”
    button.

    In the “Show/hide columns” section users can select the columns to be displayed in
    the results table. The results table contains, among others, the columns explained
    in Table 1. Table 2 explains the possible error and warning codes that may be
    reported.
