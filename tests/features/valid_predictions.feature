Feature: Valid predictions

  Scenario Outline: Predictions are valid
    Given a random seed set to <seed>
    And a list of <num_molecules> random molecules, where <num_none> entries are None
    And the representations of the molecules in <input_type> format
    And the SkinDoctorCP model
    And significance level 1 is <significance_level1>
    And significance level 2 is <significance_level2>
    And significance level 3 is <significance_level3>
    And significance level 4 is <significance_level4>

    When the model generates predictions for the molecule representations
    And the subset of the result where the input was not None is considered

    Then The result should contain the columns:
            cp_1
            cp_2
            cp_3
            cp_4
            p_sens_class
            p_nonsens_class
    # TODO: values should be checked after filtering out None values
    # And the value in column 'cp_1' should be a subset of ["Non-sensitizer", "Sensitizer", "Prediction not possible"]
    # And the value in column 'cp_2' should be a subset of ["Non-sensitizer", "Sensitizer", "Prediction not possible"]
    # And the value in column 'cp_3' should be a subset of ["Non-sensitizer", "Sensitizer", "Prediction not possible"]
    # And the value in column 'cp_4' should be a subset of ["Non-sensitizer", "Sensitizer", "Prediction not possible"]
    # And the value in column 'p_sens_class' should be between 0 and 1
    # And the value in column 'p_nonsens_class' should be between 0 and 1
